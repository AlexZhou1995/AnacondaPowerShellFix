Fix conda environment activate/deactivate issue on win10 powershell

See [this issue](https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/626) for detail. However the first solution may not work well when Anaconda Path isn't default.

But [this comment](https://github.com/conda/conda/issues/626#issuecomment-301741651) works for all kinds of settings.

This repertory is just a backup for it.
